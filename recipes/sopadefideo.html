    <h2>A Childhood Comfort Food</h2>

    <p>Fideo soup is what Mexican childhood memories are made of. It is a warm 
      comforting soup made with a tangy tomato base and golden brown 
      noodles. It is so popular with moms because it is very easy to make, and 
      kids love it because what kid doesn't like noodles?</p>
