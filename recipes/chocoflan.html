    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <h5>For The Caramel</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sugar a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>The caramel will start to form within about 5 minutes, but it is important to stir constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>It is normal for it to start forming lumps at the beginning and then it will start to melt and once it has dissolved completely and has a golden brown color, it is done.</li>
        <li>Pour the caramel into a pre-greased bundt pan and carefully move it from side to side so that the caramel covers the bottom portion of the bundt pan. Please use oven mitts for this part, because adding the hot caramel to the bundt pan will heat it up in a hurry and you don't want to get burned. </li>
        <li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before adding the flan mixture.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>For The Flan</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the flan mixture to the bundt pan where you already added the caramel.</li>
        <li>Cover the bundt pan with aluminum foil and cook using the water bath method for 35 minutes in the oven at 375 degrees F or until the flan is partially but not completely firm.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and remove the aluminum foil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>For The Chocolate Cake</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the batter according to the package instructions.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the bundt pan on top of the partially cooked flan.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375, uncovered, for an additional 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let cool for at least one hour in the refrigerator before removing as this will make it easier to remove the chocoflan from the bundt pan.</li>
        <li>Remove from the bundt pan and enjoy your perfect chocoflan!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><ol>
      <li>Cut tomatoes in half and place them with the onion and garlic in a blender.</li>
      <li>Add 1 cup of chicken stock and blend until pureed.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add pasta and stir to coat with oil. Cook stirring constantly until the pasta is nicely browned.</li>
      <li>Pour the tomato sauce. Let it sizzle while mixing for about half a minute.</li>
      <li>Add remaining chicken stock. Season with salt and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes or until fideo pasta is well cooked.</li>
    </ol>
